# User Presets Implementation

## Overview
Members can now add their own custom printer and filament presets to their personal library, separate from the global library that only admins can manage.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Personal Printer Library
- **Location**: "Your Presets" tab â†’ "Your Printers Library" section
- **Functionality**:
  - Add custom printers with name, brand, price, and lifespan
  - Edit existing personal printers
  - Delete personal printers
  - Brand filtering
  - Organized by brand with counts
  - Same UI/UX as global library

### 2. Personal Filament Library
- **Location**: "Your Presets" tab â†’ "Your Filaments Library" section
- **Functionality**:
  - Add custom filaments with type, brand, spool weight, and cost
  - Edit existing personal filaments
  - Delete personal filaments
  - Brand filtering
  - Organized by brand with counts
  - Same UI/UX as global library

### 3. Calculator Integration
- **Printer Dropdown**: Shows both global and personal printers in separate groups
  - ðŸ“š Global Library (visible to all)
  - ðŸ‘¤ Your Library (personal presets)
- **Filament Dropdown**: Shows both global and personal filaments in separate groups
  - ðŸ“š Global Library (visible to all)
  - ðŸ‘¤ Your Library (personal presets)

### 4. Firebase Database Structure
```
userPrinters/
  {userId}/
    {printerId}/
      name: "Printer Name"
      brand: "Brand Name"
      price: 299.99
      lifespan: 5000

userFilaments/
  {userId}/
    {filamentId}/
      type: "PLA"
      brand: "Brand Name"
      spoolWeight: 1000
      spoolCost: 19.99
```

### 5. Security Rules
- Users can only read and write their own presets
- Personal presets are private to each user
- Global library remains admin-only for modifications

## User Experience

2. See two sections: Your Printers Library & Your Filaments Library
3. Click **"+ Add Printer"** or **"+ Add Filament"** buttons

### Benefits
- **Personalization**: Track your own equipment and materials
