- Real-time form validation
- Progress indicators for file uploads
- Confirmation for destructive actions
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Data Structure

Complete model object stored in Firebase:
```javascript
{
  sku, designer, category, marketplace, name,
  printTime: { hours, minutes },
  filament: { source, id, type, brand, spoolWeight, spoolCost },
  supplies: [{ id, category, name, costPerItem, inStock, neededForModel, purchaseLink }],
  salesPlatform, printer,
  files: [{ id, name, size, path, url, uploadedAt }],
  createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

## Firebase Integration

### Paths Used
- `users/{userId}/models/{modelId}` - Model storage
- `users/{userId}/supplies/{supplyId}` - Supply library
- `users/{userId}/printers/{printerId}` - Printer list
- `users/{userId}/modelCategories/{categoryId}` - Category list
- `users/{userId}/filaments/{filamentId}` - User filaments
- `filaments/global/{filamentId}` - Global filaments
- `users/{userId}/models/{timestamp}_{filename}` - File storage path
