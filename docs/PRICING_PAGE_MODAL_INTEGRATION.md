# Pricing Page - Modal Integration Complete ✅

## What Was Implemented

The pricing page now has a beautiful Kindle3D-inspired authentication modal system that opens when users click "Get Started" while logged out.

## Behavior

### When User is Logged Out:
- **Navbar "Get Started"** → Opens Signup Modal
- **Free Tier "Get Started"** → Opens Signup Modal  
- **Starter Tier "Subscribe on Patreon"** → Opens Signup Modal
- **Scaling Tier "Subscribe on Patreon"** → Opens Signup Modal
- **Business Tier "Subscribe on Patreon"** → Opens Signup Modal

### When User is Logged In:
- **Navbar "Get Started"** → Redirects to `/pages/calculator.html`
- **Free Tier "Get Started"** → Redirects to `/pages/calculator.html`
- **Paid Tiers** → Redirects to Patreon subscription (as normal)
