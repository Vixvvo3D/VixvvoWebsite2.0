**Create `privacy.html`:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Privacy Policy</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>We use Patreon to manage memberships. Your Patreon data is only used to verify your membership tier. We do not share your information with third parties.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Create `terms.html`:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Terms of Service</title></head>
<body>
  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>By using this service, you agree to follow our community guidelines. Membership benefits are tied to active Patreon subscriptions.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Upload these and use their URLs.

## After You Click "Create"

1. **Copy Client ID** ‚Üí Goes in `js/patreon-config.js`
2. **Copy Client Secret** ‚Üí Goes in Firebase config
3. **That's it!** Continue with setup

---

## Still Confused?

### What Really Matters:
1. ‚úÖ **Redirect URI** - MUST be exact
2. ‚úÖ **Scopes** - Need the 3 checkboxes
3. ‚úÖ **Client ID & Secret** - You'll get after creating

### What Doesn't Matter Much:
- Description (just write something)
- App Category (any is fine)
- Icon (optional)
- Privacy/Terms URLs (can use homepage for now)

---

## The Only 2 Things That MUST Be Perfect:

### 1. Redirect URI
```
https://yourdomain.com/pages/patreon-link.html
```
- No trailing slash
- Exact path
- HTTPS in production

### 2. Scopes
```
‚úÖ identity
‚úÖ identity[email]
‚úÖ campaigns.members
```

Everything else is flexible! üéâ
